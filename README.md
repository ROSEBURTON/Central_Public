# Central_Public

Central AI is a program for your computer that opens web browser tabs that explain terminologies that you want to comprehend better.
You can manually type a list of terminologies such as "Discrete Mathematics" or "Tensorflow" and Central will use synthesis to describe
to you the description for each of your terms according to Wikipedia. In addition to being taught auditorily, Central also opens web browser
tabs in relation to your current term under images on your search engine for visual learners.

Example of the process with Central:
1. Central asks “Who will control this study session", you have 2 choices:
   "you" SCENARIO: if you type "you" then Central will use your list of terms to open tabs
   describe your term according to Wikipedia. You are then expected to jot
   down questions while Central explains your terms so that afterwards you
   can ask Central your questions to enhance your comprehension.
   
   "me" SCENARIO: if you type "me" after Central asks you “Who will take
   control of this study session" then you are responsible for asking questions
   on any material you study, whether it is a PDF, LinkedIn learning session, syllabus (etc.)
